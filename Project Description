My Library — A MERN Stack Book Management App

This is a full-stack project I built to get hands-on experience with the MERN stack. It’s a personal library tracker where you can add, update, delete, and manage the read/unread status of books.
Tech Stack
MongoDB – Stores all the book data
Express.js – Handles backend routes and API logic
React (with Vite)– For the frontend UI (super fast and clean)
Node.js – Server-side logic and connection to MongoDB
Tailwind CSS – Used for styling the frontend (kept it modern and aesthetic)
react-hot-toast– For nice little notifications when you add/edit/delete a book
Core Features:
* Add a new book (with title, author, and rating)
* Edit book details 
* Delete books
* Toggle between Read and Unread
* Real-time search by title or author
